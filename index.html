        <h2> Education Needed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Typically, a Bio-Physicist will need to have at least a masters' degree, with doctoral training being a legitimate possibility. </li>
            <li> They will need a solid grasp with concepts shown in engineering, calculus, biology,chemistry,  and other sciences, as well as most physics principals. </li>
            <li>Literacy is a must for this job, as those within it will need to be able to show critical thinking skills in their language, as well as complex thought processes.</li>
            <li>Having some engineering/technology knowledge is also a must, as a biophysicist will be repeatedly working with technology in order to simulate, and apply their findings.</li>
            <li>While certificiations such as Hazmat Certifications aren't needed for this line of work, it generally helps to be able to work well with programs such as powerpoint, adobe, and various statistics programs in order to efficiently work, and present their findings. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personality Traits, Skills and Abilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar to their education, those who work in this field will need to be able to be profecient doing complex math, often on the fly.</li>
            <li>Bio-Physicists need to be able to infer from details shown in data, as well as to group peices of data into their group. Seeing hidden patterns within math often helps those who work in this field.</li>
            <li>Of course, critical thinking, is needed for this job, similar for any other sort of position within the scientific world. </li>
            <li>People in this area will need to be able to think about the effects of their work, and how it will b e affected in the future, and they need to be integric in their personality, as to make the most sound decisions with their work.</li>
            <li>Perstistence, and Effort is required for such a rigorous field, due to the long hours, and the constant mathematical calculations.</li>
            <li>Dependability and Attention to Detail are a must, so that way their work is safe to be used, and no flaw or detail within work goes untouched. </li>
            </ul>

    <section id="technology">
        <h2>Technology, and Work Expectations</h2>
        <p> At work, Bio-Physicists are expected to conduct tests in order to investigate the chemical, and physical composition of organisms, as well as conduct tests involving the study of chemical combinations and reactions, for things such as metabolism, genetics, reproduction, and growth that are found in nature. These are often used in medical fields, as serums, hormones. These findings are generally shared through presentations at scientific confrences, or through the publication of scientific articles. Often times, those who are deeply involved within Biophysics will find themselves aiding undergraduate, and graduate students who also wish to pursue this field, by supervising research done under them. </p>

        <h2>Personal Interest</h2>
        <p> I'd like to enter this field for a myraid of reasons, but to keep it breif, it's something that I will enjoy doing for the rest of my days. Biophysics, chemistry, and the math behind it (don't get me wrong, I still struggle with it just as much as the next guy). To be able to understand, and find something of use within the worlds' sort of 'base template' is something I find to be wildly exciting, especially with the constant new discoveries, advancements, and technologies that humans make today. Being able to be a part of that is something I've long desired to do, since I was a child. The field also pays well, and generally has a work load that is manageable compared to other jobs out there. It offers plenty of opportunities for learning, as well as for travel, due to how vast, and international the scientific community is. It's overall just a good fit for me, and my interests, so I'd wish to puruse this career more so than I already am now.</p>
